# Cursor IDE Rules for cert-central-yara

## Project Context
This is a Python project that generates YARA rules from CertCentral's compromised certificate database.
It uses UV for package management, pytest for testing, and validates rules with yara-python.

## Code Style
- Use Python 3.11+ features
- Type hints are required on all functions
- Use dataclasses for data models
- Prefer async/await for I/O operations
- Use pathlib.Path instead of os.path
- Follow Google-style docstrings

## Testing Requirements
- Every function must have corresponding unit tests
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external HTTP calls in tests
- Test yara-python validation
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage

## File Organization
- Source code goes in src/cert_central_yara/
- Tests mirror source structure in tests/
- YARA rules go in rules/individual/ and rules/combined/
- CSV data goes in data/

## YARA Rule Guidelines
- Rule names must be alphanumeric with underscores only
- Serial numbers must be lowercase with colons
- All metadata fields must be escaped properly
- Rules must validate with YARA

## Git Conventions
- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, ci:)
- Branch naming: feature/*, bugfix/*, release/*
- Squash merge to main

## Dependencies
- Use UV for all package management
- Pin all dependencies in pyproject.toml
- Update uv.lock on dependency changes
