Automated YARA rule generation from the [CertGraveyard](https://certgraveyard.org) compromised certificate database.

## Features

- 🔄 **Daily Updates**: Automatically checks CertGraveyard for new compromised certificates
- 📝 **YARA Rule Generation**: Creates individual YARA rules for each certificate
- ✅ **Validation**: Validates all rules with yara-python
- 📦 **Release Management**: Automated releases with combined ruleset and ZIP archive
- 📋 **Changelog**: Maintains detailed changelog of all additions and modifications

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tjnel/cert-central-yara.git
cd cert-central-yara

# Install with UV
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Usage

```bash
# Download latest CSV from CertGraveyard
cert-central-yara download

# Check if CSV has changed
cert-central-yara check-changed

# Generate YARA rules
cert-central-yara generate

# Validate rules
cert-central-yara validate --engine yara

# Create combined file and ZIP archive
cert-central-yara combine
cert-central-yara package

# Run full pipeline
cert-central-yara run --all
```

### Using the Generated Rules

Download the latest release or use the rules directly:

```bash
# Scan with combined ruleset
yara rules/combined/MAL_Compromised_Cert_*.yara /path/to/scan

# Or use individual rules
yara rules/individual/*.yara /path/to/scan
```

## Generated Rule Format

Each rule follows this format:

```yara
import "pe"

rule MAL_Compromised_Cert_Emotet_DigiCert_0a_1b_2c_3d {
   meta:
      description         = "Detects malware Emotet using compromised certificate..."
      author              = "CertGraveyard-YARA-Generator"
      reference           = "https://certgraveyard.org"
      
      hash                = "a1b2c3d4..."
      malware             = "Emotet"
      malware_type        = "Trojan"
      
      cert_issuer         = "DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID Code Signing CA"
      cert_serial         = "0a:1b:2c:3d"
      cert_valid_from     = "2024-01-15"
      cert_valid_to       = "2025-01-15"

   condition:
      uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and
      for any sig in pe.signatures : (
         sig.issuer contains "DigiCert SHA2 Assured ID Code Signing CA" and
         sig.serial == "0a:1b:2c:3d"
      )
}
```
